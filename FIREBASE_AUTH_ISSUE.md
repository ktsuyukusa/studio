# Firebase Authentication Issue

## Problem

We've identified an issue with Firebase Authentication in the Globalink CEO application. When attempting to sign up or sign in (either with email/password or Google authentication), we're receiving the following error:

```
Error: auth/configuration-not-found
Message: Firebase: Error (auth/configuration-not-found).
```

## Cause

This error occurs when the Firebase project is not properly configured for the authentication methods being used. Specifically:

1. The authentication methods (Email/Password, Google, etc.) have not been enabled in the Firebase console.
2. For Google authentication, the OAuth client ID and secret may not be properly configured.
3. The Firebase project may not have the proper domains authorized for authentication.

## Solution

To fix this issue, you'll need to access the Firebase console and configure authentication:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select the "globalink-ceo" project
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Authentication"
4. Go to the "Sign-in method" tab
5. Enable the authentication methods you want to use:
   - For Email/Password: Click on "Email/Password", toggle "Enable", and save
   - For Google: Click on "Google", toggle "Enable", configure the OAuth client ID if needed, and save
6. In the "Authorized domains" section, make sure your domains are listed:
   - For local development: Add "localhost"
   - For production: Add your production domain

## Testing

After making these changes, you can test the authentication using the provided test files:

- `firebase-test.html` - Tests email/password authentication
- `firebase-google-test.html` - Tests Google authentication

## Additional Notes

- The Firebase configuration in the application code looks correct:
  ```javascript
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyAqXhkPnc8p8coutoZKnfLtvs92TRbDoeY",
    authDomain: "globalink-ceo.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "globalink-ceo",
    storageBucket: "globalink-ceo.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "199954181433",
    appId: "1:199954181433:web:4010fa8c76dc960477cce8"
  };
  ```
- The issue is not with the code implementation but with the Firebase project configuration.
- Once the authentication methods are properly enabled in the Firebase console, the application should work as expected.
